                <h2>Access</h2>
                <p> i.  The use of Learning Resources facilities is normally limited to use for the educational and other
                purposes of the College. </p>
                
                <p> ii. All individuals wishing to become members of the Learning Resources must comply with the registration
                procedures. These include an undertaking to abide by Learning Resources rules.</p>
    
                <p> iii. Individuals or organisations who are not eligible for membership but have good reason to use the Learning
                Resources may be admitted, by arrangement, for purposes of study only. Procedures for seeking admission
                are outlined in the External Services leaflet. Non-members must sign the Visitors' Book on each visit,
                and may be required to produce written identification.  Study use does not include access to the College's
                Academic Network.</p>
                
                <p> iv. ID cards issued by the College or Learning Resources are not transferable from one person to another. 
                The person named on each card is responsible for all items borrowed on it and is liable for the cost of
                replacement of the card or items borrowed on it in the event of loss or damage. </p>
                
                <p><em>Users of the Learning Resources are reminded that they must be willing to show  ID cards
                or other identification when requested to do so by College staff. </em></p>

                <h2>Use of Facilities</h2>
                <p>i.   The Learning Resources is not responsible for loss of, or damage to, the personal belongings
                of its users and visitors.  Users must take reasonable precautions against theft of their belongings,
                and must not leave belongings unattended even for a very short period. Study tables/PCs may not be
                reserved by depositing clothing or private property on the adjacent seat.  Articles left unattended
                may be removed by Learning Resources staff but will be returned on request at the Reception Desk.</p>
                
                <p>ii.	All users are required to conduct themselves quietly throughout the Learning Resources
                and conversation between users must be kept to a minimum.  No conversation is permitted in those parts
                of the Learning Resources designated as ‘Silent’ areas</p>

                <p>iii. Personal stereos may not be used in the Learning Resources.</p>

                <p>iv.	Mobile phones must be turned off in all Learning Resources study areas.
                Their use is permitted in the enclosed stair wells of the Main Site building.
                Circumstances at the Clinical Site Libraries may vary.</p>

                <p>v.   Users should not make use of mains electrical supplies to power their own equipment,
                including external storage devices,  unless the equipment has been tested and confirmed as meeting the
                required Health & Safety standards.  Written evidence of such compliance will be required.</p>

                <p>vi.	Eating and drinking are not permitted in any of the public areas of the Learning Resources.</p>

                <p>vii.	Action will be taken against any person misusing furniture, facilities or materials.
                Any such person may be required to pay for the making good damage or loss.</p>
